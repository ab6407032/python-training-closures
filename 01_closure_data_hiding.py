"""
Use Case: âœ… Data Hiding using Closures
---------------------------------------
Closures allow functions to store state in a private scope.
This is useful when you want to retain information across function calls
without using global variables or object-oriented programming.

ðŸ”’ Real-life Analogy:
A vending machine remembers how much money you've inserted, 
but this state isn't visible or modifiable from outside.
